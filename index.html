            <div>In year 2020, I had a great fascination to learn the German Language and start my career in Germany. To be well acquainted with the German language, I started searching German language classes and I found this class. I started from scratch, with 0 prior German knowledge. So when i started here, i felt that i could lag behind with no prior knowledge, but with the profound German knowledge, Immense Experience and Exquisite teaching skills of Esha mam, I never felt lagging behind. After finishing A1 level, I started developing more interest about the language, about german culture and i got the motive, to never stop learning this language. I ended up finishing B1 level here with not only boosting my german language skills, but also it evolved my personality with the great lessons that Mam taught. If big brand name doesn't matter to you and you really want to have a genuine teacher, with whom you can learn the language with tremendous motivation and too much fun, this is the class for you!!!<br><br>- Yash Ghayal<br>Pursuing M.Eng in Automotive (TH Ingolstadt, Germany)

            <div>I decided to re-learn German during my Engineering in 2019 after a gap of six years. As for any language, if you don’t use it for a while, you lose it. I was barely able to introduce myself in German when I first started coaching with Isha ma’am. With the level A1 examination date in sight, I remember being pretty stressed about being able to cope up with the syllabus and achieve key deliverables on the examination day. I believe this is what most learners struggle with and this is exactly where Isha ma’am shines. She, with her friendly, welcoming and encouraging personality makes sure that all her students become comfortable and loosen up towards a pretty complex language. Having doubts and asking questions is key to learning any language and she, as a coach always maintained a healthy atmosphere for the same. I’ve had a fair share of experience with a lot of teachers and I can personally vouch for her rare and almost unique quality of pacing herself differently for each student while making sure the core foundations for the language are built well. Her speaking and listening sessions prior to the exam surely kick out a ton of nervousness. She adjusted a lot for my academic commitments and pushed me when I slacked for no reason at all. This is what graduate students,  irrespective of their domains will find very helpful.  If you are genuinely interested in the German language, as a hobby or to get a certificate, you can find all the help you need right here.<br><br>- Hrishikesh Deshmukh<br>(Supply Chain @ Whirlpool USA, State University of New York at Buffalo)
